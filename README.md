# Steps to run

# What to build

The following is a list of items (prioritized from most important to least important) we wish to see:

- [x] Design and implement a documented RESTful API for the game (think of a mobile app for your API)
- [x] Implement an API client library for the API designed above. Ideally, in a different language, of your preference, to the one used for the API
- [x] When a cell with no adjacent mines is revealed, all adjacent squares will be revealed (and repeat)
- [x] Ability to 'flag' a cell with a question mark or red flag
- [x] Detect when game is over
- [x] Persistence
- [x] Time tracking
- [x] Ability to start a new game and preserve/resume the old ones
- [x] Ability to select the game parameters: number of rows, columns, and mines
- [x] Ability to support multiple users/accounts
